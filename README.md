# Traffic-Delay-Severity-Predictor

This project explores machine learning techniques to classify the severity of traffic delays caused by roadway accidents using features available at the time of the incident. The analysis is based on the US Accidents dataset, which contains over 7.7 million records, and applies four classification methods: logistic regression (baseline), random forest, histogram-based gradient boosting (HGBoost), and a neural network with a multilayer perceptron (MLP) structure.
